# Fun with ILogger in Azure functions.

## Dependency injection
Use dependency injection to inject a nice specific ILogger<MyHttpParser> into your MyHttpParser class. This is the "right" thing to do, because now you can control what happens to output from the MyHttpParser class at runtime via config. Hooray!

Only, in the Azure functions world, this means bugger all. By default, anything from a specific log category is filtered out. You need to edit host.json to make sure that your custom output gets included. 

## File logging at during development
This is super handy. In host.json, use
```
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "logging": {
    "fileLoggingMode": "always"
}
```
This causes ILogger output to be written into files stored in C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\Temp\LogFiles\Application\Functions.
There's a file for output from the host, and then 1 file per function. Unless you've done the right thing and used ILogger<MyHttpParser> via DI. All that output goes into the host log file. The only output that goes into the function log files comes from the ILogger passed into the function. Sigh. 

## Too...much....information
The quickest way to get up and running is to set logging.logLevel.default to Information. You'll see all your function output, but you'll also see a whole load of Azure functions output as well. 

The trick is to realise that there's a hierarchy to these log categories 
 - All output from the Azure functions host has a category prefixed with "Host". 
 - All the output from an ILogger passed to YOUR function is prefixed with "Function"
 - Other custom categories i.e. YourApp.MyHttpParser

Then it's a matter of tweaking host.json until you only get the output you're interested in. 
```
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "logging": {
    "fileLoggingMode": "always",         
    "logLevel": {
      "MyStuff": "Information",      
      "default": "Error",
      "Host": "Error",      
      "Function":"Information",
      "Function.Http-v2-StartScheduledAgents": "Error"
    }       
  }
}
```

In this example, 
 - I only want to hear from the functions host if there are error logs
 - I want to see all output from any of my custom log categories (classes that start with MyStuff)
 - All of my own functions should output info and above
  - Except the Http-v2-StartScheduledAgents function. I only want to know if there's an error

You're still limited in that any DI injected ILogger sends output to host.log, while any function method injected ILogger outputs to function.log
