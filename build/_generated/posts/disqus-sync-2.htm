Let&#39;s store all the comment counts there too.</p>
<p>And hey, at the same time, let&#39;s go for a less naive approach for grabbing comments from disqus.</p>
<p>New syncing technique - instead of listing ALL threads (aka, stories), let&#39;s just list <em>posts</em> (aka, comments) made against those threads. We can query for posts made since a certain date, meaning that we can query for posts made since we last checked for posts. </p>
<p>If we query once per minute that means we&#39;ll end up with 60 disqus requests per hour, which is well under the 1,000 limit. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there&#39;s a massive influx of comments we&#39;ll have to make multiple calls to diqus to page through the results - you&#39;re limited to a max of 100 items per response. But we are talking about a <em>huge</em> number of comments in a short space of time to make that a problem for us. </p>
